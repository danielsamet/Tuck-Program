	          default limit below 0, default discount type, alert for low quantity, alerts for offers ending soon


Notes:
I have forgotten specifics in what needs working on with accounts. Main functions have been implemented so I have moved on to products
Edit the btns for edit/delete and the like by splitting them to simplify them
Add functionality to adding items so that the 'Enter' key can be used
Add search functionality where one would type without needing to click a search button and it would narrow down the results
Create an exporter
Globalise font details
enable importing of accounts with minimum of f/l_name and budget and for products with just name and selling price
Create a user system and encrypt database so it can only be accessed through the program
Allow editing of budget for user with the right credentials
Allow extension of data that is time bound (for example extending an offer on an item)
-------
use data validation / correction when importing: 
	do not allow more than one account with the same name;
	do not allow more data on any account than necessary / only import relevant info
page movement after adding account
page scrolling with exact number per page(s)
data validation for adding entries


future plans:
create web server for multiple clients to access
use raspi zero w as a server for multiple clients to access (augment it with an rtc chip)
log (with full timestamps)
verify actions complete successfully and report accordingly
Provide multiple view types (grid, compact, etc.)
